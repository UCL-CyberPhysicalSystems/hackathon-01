# :nut_and_bolt: Hacking cyber-physical systems in real-time 

![fig](docs/figures/team-ucl-cps-hackathon-01.svg)

## :scroll: Description
The UCL Departments of Advanced Research Computing (ARC) and Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering (CEGE) are organising a series of hackathons that combine software infrastructure from ARC with hardware and sensor infrastructure from CEGE. 
The aim is to enable UCL teams to explore cyber-physical systems, embodied AI, and physical AI.
Additionally, these hackathons aim to spark new projects and collaborations that may lead to innovative applications for existing sensors, robots, and GPU servers, extending their use beyond current domains such as manufacturing, aerospace, healthcare, and security.

### Hackathon 1: Preliminary Small Hackathon for Feasibility and Idea Generation
WHO: 5–6 ARC staff, including someone from Environments to assist with setting up VMs. Other useful participants would include staff involved in current projects using live data, and those with knowledge of ROS.   
WHAT: Address initial issues in network connectivity, VMs, and ROS. Generate ideas for Hackathon 2, assessing feasibility and planning the necessary work in preparation.    
WHEN: Late January 2026 (FYI: TIP dates are 14–15 January 2026).   
WHERE: UCL Here East (G40).    

### Hackathon 2: Larger Hackathon to Explore Ideas and Create Projects 
WHO: 20–30 ARC staff — open to anyone interested, though ideally including all attendees from Hackathon 1.    
WHAT: Explore project ideas in key areas such as:  Data (collection, processing, visualisation), Machine learning applied to live data, Live data infrastructure and security, Robot control.    
WHEN: Late April 2026 (FYI: TIP dates are 15–16 April 2026); or Late July 2026 (FYI: TIP dates are 7–8 July 2026).    
WHERE: UCL Here East (G40).

## :school: Express interest
Registration is free. 
You can express your interest by commenting on this discussion [ticket](https://github.com/UCL-CyberPhysicalSystems/hackathon-01/discussions/categories/express-of-interest) with your GitHub username, your availability, the skills you have, and the ones you’d like to learn.

## :computer: TODISCUSS Pre-requisites 
* [ ] Highlight Hackathon 1 in Q4 2025 planning meeting to ensure attending staff will have availability. 
* [ ] Set up minimal ROS2 VM, test on ARC infrastucture ([dockerfile](https://github.com/mxochicale/nvidia-open-source-robot-lab/blob/main/Dockerfile))
* [ ] Test [zenoh bridge](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-plugin-ros2dds), VPNs for connectivity between local networks 
* [ ] Participants are required to bring their own computers, either with a CPU or GPU. Computers with GPUs are ideal for prototyping models.
* [ ] VMs with GPUs? 
* [ ] GitHub username (or [sign up](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) for a GitHub account if you don’t have one).
* [ ] Next meeting early November 2025
